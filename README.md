Created with CodeSandbox.

Been fascinated alot with financial charts especially the candleaticks and would like to drop a little bit of background --- Candlestick charts originated in Japan over 100 years before the West developed the bar and point-and-figure charts. In the 1700s, a Japanese man named Homma discovered that, while there was a link between price and the supply and demand of rice, the markets were strongly influenced by the emotions of traders.

Candlesticks show that emotion by visually representing the size of price moves with different colors. Traders use the candlesticks to make trading decisions based on regularly occurring patterns that help forecast the short-term direction of the price.

#KEY TAKEAWAYS

1. Candlestick charts are used by traders to determine possible price movement based on past patterns.
2. Candlesticks are useful when trading as they show four price points (open, close, high, and low) throughout the period of time the trader specifies.
3. Many algorithms are based on the same price information shown in candlestick charts.
4. Trading is often dictated by emotion, which can be read in candlestick charts.
